## Summary
For reverse-engineering OEM UDS DIDs, you need this setup

- a windows machine
- SavvyCAN
- Tactrix Openport 2.0 drivers installed; make sure they're for x64 too as SavvyCAN is built for x64
- OBD Y cable


Note: 
- Tactrix uses a leading 0 for all UDS paramids, SavvyCAN does not

TODO 
- test SavvyCAN on macOS
