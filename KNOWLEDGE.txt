- special characters can fuck it up
- check logcfg.out for debug info
- amber flashing means it's ready but not established comms yet (before car is in ignition)
- hard amber plus flashing purple means it's recording
- if it glows hard yellow (amber) WITHOUT flashing purple in between, it's stuck and not recording: maybe if some parameter is not responding??
